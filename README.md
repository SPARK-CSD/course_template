## "What's in this repository?"

This repository contains the template for `SPARK` courses at Northwestern University.

Through this template, we hope to streamline the creation, management, sustainability and distribution of courses conducted as part of `SPARK`. All courses created through this template are intended to either work as quarter-long courses or 3-5 day workshops.

Members of `SPARK` or anyone interested can use this template to create new courses. We created another repository to outline how this template can be used.
