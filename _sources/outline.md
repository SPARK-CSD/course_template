# General outline

Within this course we will course_description. To do so, we will follow a “learning by doing” approach in a tripartite manner. Starting from a [basic introduction  (Block I)](https://spark-csd.github.io/course_name/introduction/pages/introduction.html), we will [run actual experiments/analyzes (Block II)](https://spark-csd.github.io/course_name/experimentation/pages/experimentation.html) planned and conducted by you, as well as [communicate/present the obtained results (Block III)](https://spark-csd.github.io/course_name/finalization/pages/finalization.html). Thus, we actively seek out realistic examples and workflows that mimic the lifecycle of real-world projects, trying to present you with both a respective overview and hands-on experience.

### When and where do we meet?

As this won't be a "classic" course that entails weekly lectures/assignments, etc. but instead utilizes a different outline that is oriented along the research process, we will have sessions with varying content (situated within three main blocks: [introduction/background](https://spark-csd.github.io/course_name/introduction/pages/introduction.html), [project execution](https://spark-csd.github.io/course_name/experimentation/pages/experimentation.html), [project finalization](https://spark-csd.github.io/course_name/finalization/pages/finalization.html)) every now and then. Combined with a strong focus on project work and direct supervision, we will organize meetings as we go with all participants. Thus, please watch out for E-Mails/Discord notifications!  

The in-person meetings will take place in [location_name](location_link)!

### Schedule

Please see below for our current _optimistic_ schedule. Depending on our progress, potential problems and different forms of learning, content and times might change a bit. Each lecture will be divided into several parts separated by a 5-10 minute break and might constitute a transition from basic to advanced concepts, theoretic to practical sessions and individual to group work. The different parts are roughly indicated in the schedule below like this:

🗓 - important information on date & time  
💡 - input from the instructor  
👩🏽‍🏫👨🏻‍🏫 - instructor presents content  
🥼 - research project work  
🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻 - work on demo data  
🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬 - work on own research project  
🖥️ - computational work outside course hours  
✍🏽 - writing outside course hours  
📖 - reading outside course hours
