# Student projects

As mentioned on the [overview page](), the core of this class are research projects that will be conducted under guidance (potentially in groups), the `research experiment`s, by each participant. This is explained in a bit more detail below and generated materials for each (e.g. `pre-registration`, `DMP`, etc.) will be added throughout the semester.

## Research project

Building upon the work of the [Introduction block](), the aim of the `research project` is to allow you to conduct `research work` more independently. While everyone will use the same basic experimental setup, each group/participant will form their own `sub-projects` and respective `hypotheses`. In general the steps will the same as discussed in the [Introduction block](): setting up a project, finding literature, defining hypotheses, do a pre-registering, write a data management plan, set up the experiment, acquire data, analyze data and write a report based on the outcomes. In addition, the `research project` will also entail the presentation of relevant literature and a poster presentation.
